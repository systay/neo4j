Match
=====

In the match part of a query, the pattern is described. The description of the
pattern is made up of one or more paths, separated by commas.

Node identifiers can be used with or without surrounding parenthesis. These two match clauses are semantically identical:

+`MATCH (a)-->(b)`+

and 

+`MATCH a-->b`+

All parts of the pattern must be directly or indirectly bound to a start point.


The optional relationship is a way to describe parts of the pattern that can evaluate to null if it can not be
matched to the real graph. It's the equivalent of SQL outer join - if Cypher finds one or more matches, they will be
returned. If no matches are found, Cypher will return a null.

Optionality travels - if a part of the pattern can only be reached from a bound point through an optional relationship,
that part is also optional. Also, named paths that contain optional parts are also optional - if any part of the path is
null, the whole path is null.

In these example, b and p are all optional and can contain null:

+`START a=node(1)`+
+`MATCH p = a-[?]->b`+

+`START a=node(1)`+
+`MATCH p = a-[*?]->b`+

+`START a=node(1)`+
+`MATCH p = a-[?]->x-->b`+

+`START a=node(1), x=node(100)`+
+`MATCH p = shortestPath( a-[*?]->x )`+
