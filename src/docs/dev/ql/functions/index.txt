== Predicates ==
Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the +WHERE+ part of a query.

include::all.txt[]
include::any.txt[]
include::none.txt[]
include::single.txt[]

== Scalar functions ==
Scalar functions return a single value.

include::length.txt[]
include::type.txt[]
include::id.txt[]


== Iterable functions ==
Iterable functions return an iterable of things - nodes in a path, and so on.

include::nodes.txt[]
include::relationships.txt[]
include::extract.txt[]
