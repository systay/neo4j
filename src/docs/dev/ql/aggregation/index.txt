Aggregation
===========

To calculate aggregated data, Cypher offers a aggregation, much like SQL's GROUP BY.
If any aggregation functions are found in the RETURN statement, all the columns without aggregating functions are used as the grouping key.

== COUNT ==
COUNT is used to count the number of rows. COUNT can be used in two forms - COUNT(*)
which just counts the number of matching rows, and COUNT(<identifier>), which counts
the number of non-null values in <identifier>.

include::count-non-null-values.txt[]

== SUM ==
The SUM aggregation function simply sums all the numeric values it encounters. Null values are silently dropped.

== AVG ==
AVG calculates the average of a numeric column.

== MAX ==
Returns the largest value.

== MIN ==
Returns the smallest value.
