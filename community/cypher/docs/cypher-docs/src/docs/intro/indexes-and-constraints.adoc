= Indexes and Constraints

Labels allow you to group nodes, and add indexes or constraints to them.
Adding an index gives fast lookups for starting nodes in the graph.

== Lookup Indexes

In general, for a graph query to run fast, you don't need indexes, you only need them to find your starting points.
After that initial lookups you rely on the in-graph structures and first class citizenship of relationships in the graph database to achieve high performance.

You would create an index like this: +CREATE INDEX ON :Movie(title)+

== Unique Constraints

You can also specify unique constraints that guarantee uniqueness of a certain property on nodes with a specific label.

These constraints are also used by the +MERGE+ clause to make certain that a node only exists once.

A constraint definition would look like this: +CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE+.
