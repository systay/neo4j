o Fixed bug #140 - Identifier can now named same thing as a parameter
o Fixed bug that tripped up the patter matchern when a node is sent in as a parameter

o Fixed bug #170 - Arrays are now pretty-printed instead of Array.toString

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o Added allShortestPaths
o Added COALESCE
o Added column aliasing with AS
o Variable length relationships can now introduce a rel-iterable
o BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the syntax for iterable predicated ALL/NONE/ANY/SINGLE to use WHERE instead of a colon
o BREAKING CHANGE: ExecutionResult is now a read-once, forward only iterator. 
o Fixed problems with optional graph elements

1.6.M01 (2011-11-24)
--------------------
o Made zero length (a single node) paths possible
o Skip, limit and regular expressions can now be parameterized

o Parameters for literals, index queries and node/relationship id
o Shortest path added
o Pattern matcher will, if possible, eliminate subgraphs early, by using the predicates from the WHERE clause
o Relationships can be bound now
o Added IS NULL for NULL checking
