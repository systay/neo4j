Aggregation
===========

To calculate aggregated data, Cypher offers aggregation, much like SQL's +GROUP BY+.
If any aggregation functions are found in the +RETURN+ statement, all the columns without aggregating functions are used as the grouping key.

== COUNT ==
+COUNT+ is used to count the number of rows. +COUNT+ can be used in two forms - +COUNT(*)+
which just counts the number of matching rows, and +COUNT(<identifier>)+, which counts
the number of non-null values in +<identifier>+.
