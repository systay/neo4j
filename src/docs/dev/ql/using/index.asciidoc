Using
=====

If you do not specify an explicit +START+ clause, Cypher needs to infer where in the graph to start your query.
One way Cypher might find start points is by looking at available indexes, but currently this can only be done automatically
when there is only one index that is applicable to the query.
If there is more than one possible index to use, you must use an index hint to tell cypher which index to use.

NOTE: You cannot use index hints if your query has a +START+ clause.
