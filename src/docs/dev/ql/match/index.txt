[[query-match]]
Match
=====

In the match part of a query, the pattern is described. The description of the
pattern is made up of one or more paths, separated by commas.

Node identifiers can be used with or without surrounding parenthesis. These two match clauses are semantically identical:

+MATCH (a)-->(b)+

and 

+MATCH a-->b+

All parts of the pattern must be directly or indirectly bound to a start point.
