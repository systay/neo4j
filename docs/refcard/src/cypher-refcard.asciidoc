*Cypher is the declarative query language for Neo4j, the world’s leading graph database.*

Key principles and capabilities of Cypher are as follows:

* Cypher matches patterns of nodes and relationship in the graph, to extract information or modify the data.
* Cypher has the concept of identifiers which denote named, bound elements and parameters.
* Cypher can create, update, and remove nodes, relationships, labels, and properties.
* Cypher manages indexes and constraints.

Note: `{value}` denotes either literals, for ad hoc Cypher queries; or parameters, which is the best practice for applications.
Neo4j properties can be strings, numbers, booleans or arrays thereof.
Cypher also supports maps and collections.

| NULL
| 
* +NULL+ is used to represent missing/undefined values.
* +NULL+ is not equal to +NULL+.
  Not knowing two values does not imply that they are the same value. 
  So the expression `NULL = NULL` yields +NULL+ and not +TRUE+.
  To check if an expressoin is +NULL+, use +IS NULL+.
* Arithmetic expressions, comparisons and function calls (except +coalesce+) will return +NULL+ if any argument is +NULL+.
* Missing elements like a property that doesn't exist or accessing elements that don't exist in a collection yields +NULL+.
* In +OPTIONAL MATCH+ clauses, ++NULL++s will be used for missing parts of the pattern.

|Upgrading
|
With Neo4j 2.0 several Cypher features in version 1.9 have been deprecated or removed.

* +START+ is optional.
* +MERGE+ will take +CREATE UNIQUE+'s role for the unique creation of patterns.
  Note that they are not the same, though.
* Optional relationships are handled by +OPTIONAL MATCH+, not question marks.
* Non-existing properties return +NULL+, +n.prop?+ and +n.prop!+ have been removed.
* The separator for collection functions changed form +:+ to +\|+.
* Paths are no longer collections, use +nodes(path)+ or +rels(path)+.
* Parentheses around nodes in patterns are no longer optional.
* +CREATE a=\{property:’value’\}+ has been removed.
* Use +REMOVE+ to remove properties.
* Parameters for index-keys and nodes in patterns are no longer allowed.
* To still use the older syntax, prepend your Cypher statement with `CYPHER 1.9`.

|Performance
| 
* Use parameters instead of literals when possible.
  This allows Cypher to re-use your queries instead of having to parse and build new execution plans.
* Always set an upper limit for your variable length patterns.
  It's easy to have a query go wild and touch all nodes in a graph by mistake.
* Return only the data you need.
  Avoid returning whole nodes and relationships -- instead, pick the data you need and return only that.
