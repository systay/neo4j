[[query-with]]
With
====
The ability to chain queries together allows for powerful constructs. In Cypher, the +WITH+ clause is
used to pipe the result from one query to the next.

+WITH+ is also used to separate reading from updating of the graph. Every sub-query of a query must either be
a read-only or a write-only.

[TIP]
Only variables that are explicitly named in the prepending +WITH+ clause can be seen be the following sub-query.
Everything else is isolated from the following statements and not visible.
